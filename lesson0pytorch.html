    <h1 id="title">Deep Learning With Pytorch: Course Introduction</h1>
    <div id="text">
        <p>Are you trying to learn deep learning with Pytorch but can't understand online content? Are you trying to transfer from Tensorflow or any other deep learning library? Then this course is for you. In only a few lessons, you'll be able to make high accuracy models with Pytorch in only a few lines of code!</p>
        <h1 class="sub">Who This Course Is For:</h1>
        <p>This course is for anyone trying to learn deep learning with Pytorch.</p>
        <h1 class="sub">Prerequisites:</h1>
        <p>You should be able to write Python code comfortably. You don't need much linear algebra or calculus.</p>
        <h1 class="sub">What Makes This Course Special:</h1>
        <p>This course takes a different approach than any other course. We take the process of building a model step by step each lesson and explain the theory and how to implement it. This means that you can grasp the whole step without having bits of it in every lesson making your life easier.</p>
